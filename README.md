# Unbound Labs Showcase

Public landing-page showcase for my technical interests, career development system, and role-readiness work.

## Live Site
- Website: https://unbound-labs.com
- Goal: one organized place for my technical direction, progress, and professional narrative

## What This Represents
- A personal operating system for growth toward advanced diagnostics/field technical roles
- Structured development loop: practice -> artifacts -> review -> improvement
- Career-focused documentation that stays practical and execution-oriented

## Unbound Games
Unbound Games is the game-design track in this portfolio, focused on systemic action gameplay, world progression, and long-horizon simulation loops.

### SpriteAdventureBattle
- A 2D action-RPG pathfinder designed for faster iteration.
- Initial focus is a tight arena-combat core with responsive, skill-driven encounters.
- Long-term direction expands into survival-building and dynamic world governance systems.

### VillageCraft
- A 3D implementation of the same broader design vision.
- Built in Unity with C# and curated asset pipelines.
- Focused on immersive exploration, construction systems, and layered world simulation.

## Additional Product Tracks

### Diagnostic TUI
- A field-first terminal interface for structured triage and repeatable diagnostics workflows.
- Designed to reduce ambiguity during incident handling through consistent operator steps.
- Positioned as a practical tooling layer for faster issue isolation and cleaner handoffs.

### Nourish
- A personalized nutrition and meal-planning product focused on decision support and routine adherence.
- Emphasizes user context, actionable recommendations, and long-term consistency.
- Explores AI-assisted planning as a quality-of-life multiplier, not a novelty feature.

### LegalKit
- A compliance experience focused on simplifying policy management and operational readiness.
- Centers on clear policy generation, consent visibility, and practical website compliance coverage.
- Built as a reliability-oriented toolkit for teams that need confidence without legal complexity overhead.

### Debug Lab
- A hands-on protocol and systems validation environment for embedded debugging workflows.
- Focuses on instrumentation discipline, reproducible test paths, and evidence-based troubleshooting.
- Serves as the practical bridge between theory and high-pressure diagnostic execution.
