# FTS Career Showcase

A public overview of the systems and workflow I built to develop into my next role.

## Purpose
This is a **career landing page repo** that explains how I’m building technical depth, operating discipline, and field execution standards for advanced diagnostics roles.

I keep implementation code private and use this page to show:
- what I’m working toward,
- how I structure my development,
- what skills I’m actively sharpening,
- and how I document growth over time.

## Live Site
- Main landing page: https://web-one-lyart-80.vercel.app
- Focus: personal operating system for technical growth, troubleshooting rigor, and role readiness

## What I Built (High Level)
- Structured learning and execution framework for field technical work
- Evidence-first development loop (practice -> artifacts -> review -> improvement)
- Personal dashboard for tracking readiness, projects, and technical progress
- Resume and career narrative aligned to real role requirements

## Core Areas I’m Developing
- Electrical and embedded diagnostics (CAN, LIN, EtherCAT)
- Linux-based debugging workflow
- Scope/DMM-driven fault isolation
- Python + SQL for incident and trend analysis
- Technical documentation and escalation communication

## Why This Matters
I wanted a single place that keeps my learning practical and measurable. The goal is not just studying topics, but showing repeatable execution under pressure:
- diagnose correctly,
- communicate clearly,
- and improve system-level outcomes over time.

## Role Alignment
Target direction: Field Technical Specialist / advanced diagnostics roles in robotics and high-reliability systems.

This workspace is designed to reinforce:
- systematic troubleshooting,
- cross-functional communication,
- and technical ownership in fast-moving environments.

## Current Status
- Active and continuously updated
- Used personally to improve technical depth and execution quality
- Public page is for professional overview; implementation details remain private
